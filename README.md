## 📌 Project Title  
**FLAMES Game – Pure Logic Python Script**

## 🧠 About the Project  
These are just basic Python games purely using algorithms and functions, not importing anything like `pygame` or other stuff.  
It’s all about logic — **pure logiccc** 🧠🔥

This script implements the classic FLAMES game using basic Python — loops, conditions, and string operations. No external libraries are used.

## ⚙️ How the Script Works  

1. Takes two names as input  
2. Removes special characters, dots, and spaces  
3. Cancels out matching characters between the names  
4. Counts the remaining letters  
5. Applies that count to the word `FLAMES` to determine the relationship type

**FLAMES stands for:**

- `F` – Friends  
- `L` – Love  
- `A` – Affection  
- `M` – Marriage  
- `E` – Enemies  
- `S` – Siblings
